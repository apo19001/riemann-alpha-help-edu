# riemann-alpha-help-edu

# Overview
We decided to make our idea a little concrete. For it to fulfill requirements, we have decided to allow the user to input a question, and then it will be queried by Riemann alpha. The question can be arithmetic related, any type of question a student may have on a problem they on homework.  It won’t verify the answer, but it will allow the student to put in what they think the math question’s answer is, and Riemann Alpha will give the correct answer. 

We wanted students to be introuduced to a homework helper that would allow them to ask questions that would be given on their homework. We wanted it to make it as simple as possible
